[Lorentz Transformations
- Equations linking space and time in different frames.
- Derived from Einsteinâ€™s postulates.
- Affect time, length, and simultaneity.
]
---
[Relativity of Simultaneity
- Two observers moving relative to each other do not agree on simultaneous events.
- Example: Train and lightning strike experiment.
]
---
[Energy and Momentum Conservation
- Even in relativity, total energy and momentum remain conserved.
- Need to use relativistic definitions.
]
---
[Causality and the Speed of Light
- No information can travel faster than light.
- Violating this would allow time travel and paradoxes.

[Impact on Modern Physics
- Laid foundation for general relativity.
- Essential for understanding the universe.
- Enables technologies like nuclear power and particle accelerators.

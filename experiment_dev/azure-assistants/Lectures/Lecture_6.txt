[Bohrâ€™s Model of the Atom
- Electrons orbit in quantized energy levels.
- No radiation emitted unless electrons jump between levels.
]
---
[Spectral Lines
- Atoms absorb and emit specific wavelengths of light.
- Explained by quantized energy levels.
]
---
[Limitations of the Bohr Model
- Only works for hydrogen.
- Fails for multi-electron atoms.
]
---
[Wave-Particle Duality
- Light exhibits both wave and particle properties.
- Introduced by Einstein and de Broglie.

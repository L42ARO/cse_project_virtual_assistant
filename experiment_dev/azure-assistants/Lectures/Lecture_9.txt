[Spin and Quantum Mechanics
- Electrons have intrinsic angular momentum.
- Two states: Spin-up and spin-down.

[Pauli Exclusion Principle
- No two electrons can have the same quantum numbers.
- Explains atomic structure and periodic table.

---
[Quantum Superposition
- Particles exist in multiple states until measured.
- Basis for quantum computing.

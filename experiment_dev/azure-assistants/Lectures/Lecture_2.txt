[Time Dilation
- Moving observers experience time at a slower rate.
- Light clock thought experiment: A clock moving at speed v ticks slower.
- Formula: Δt' = Δt / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).
- Verified by fast-moving particles (muons) and GPS satellites.

[Length Contraction
- Objects moving at high speeds shrink along their direction of motion.
- Formula: L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).
- Only significant at speeds close to c.

[Relativistic Velocity Addition
- Unlike classical physics, velocities do not add normally.
- Formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c²).
- Ensures nothing exceeds the speed of light.

[Twin Paradox
- One twin travels at near-light speed, the other stays on Earth.
- The traveling twin ages slower and returns younger.
- Resolved by noting the traveler undergoes acceleration, breaking symmetry.

[Experimental Proofs of Relativity
- Muon decay: Muons live longer when moving at high speeds.
- GPS: Needs relativistic corrections to maintain accuracy.

[Relativistic Energy and Momentum
- Newtonian mechanics: p = mv, KE = ½mv².
- Relativistic momentum: p = γmv (where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)).
- Kinetic energy increases drastically near c.

[E = mc²: Mass-Energy Equivalence
- Mass is a form of energy.
- Small amounts of mass release huge energy (nuclear reactions).
- Example: Nuclear fission in atomic bombs.

[Relativistic Doppler Effect
- Light changes frequency due to relative motion.
- Formula: f' = f sqrt((1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c)).
- Applications: Redshift in astronomy.

[Spacetime Diagrams
- Time and space form a single entity: spacetime.
- Events are points in spacetime.
- Light cone: Defines causality.

[Applications of Special Relativity
- GPS satellites need relativistic corrections.
- Particle accelerators rely on relativistic mass increase.
- Astrophysical objects (black holes, neutron stars) obey relativistic laws.

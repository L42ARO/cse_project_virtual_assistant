[Rutherford’s Gold Foil Experiment
- Shot alpha particles at a thin gold foil.
- Most passed through, but some deflected sharply.
- Conclusion: Atoms have a small, dense nucleus.

[Limitations of Classical Models
- Classical physics predicted electrons would spiral into the nucleus.
- Needed a new theory: Quantum mechanics.

[Introduction to Quantum Ideas
- Energy levels must be quantized.
- Light behaves as both a particle and a wave.

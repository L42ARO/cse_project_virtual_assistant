[Introduction to Special Relativity
- Classical physics assumes absolute space and time.
- Newtonian mechanics explains everyday motion but fails at high speeds.
- The need for a new theory arose from inconsistencies in electromagnetism and mechanics.
- Special relativity fundamentally changes our understanding of time, space, and motion.

[Postulates of Special Relativity
- Einstein’s two postulates:
  1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
  2. The speed of light (c) is constant in all reference frames.
- These postulates challenge classical notions of time and space.
- Implications: No absolute rest frame, simultaneity is relative.

[Galilean Relativity and Its Limitations
- In classical mechanics, velocities add linearly: v_total = v1 + v2.
- This fails for light: Experiments show c is always constant.
- Example: A moving flashlight should add velocity to light, but it does not.

[The Michelson-Morley Experiment
- Attempted to measure Earth's motion through the ether.
- Used an interferometer to detect differences in light speed in different directions.
- Found no difference → The ether hypothesis was incorrect.
- This result led Einstein to propose special relativity.

[Consequences of Special Relativity
- Space and time are not absolute but relative.
- Time dilation: Moving clocks run slower.
- Length contraction: Moving objects shrink in their direction of motion.
- Mass-energy equivalence: E = mc².

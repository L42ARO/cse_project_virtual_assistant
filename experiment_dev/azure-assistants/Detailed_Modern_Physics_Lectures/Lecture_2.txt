[Time Dilation: The Relativistic Clock
- Moving clocks run slower compared to stationary ones.
- Derived from the light clock thought experiment.
- Mathematical formula: Δt' = Δt / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).
- Validated by experiments with high-speed particles.

[Length Contraction: The Moving Rod
- Objects in motion appear shorter along the direction of motion.
- Formula: L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).
- This effect only becomes noticeable at high velocities.

[Relativistic Velocity Transformations
- Unlike classical mechanics, velocities do not simply add.
- Einstein's velocity addition formula: u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv/c²).
- Ensures that no object surpasses the speed of light.

[Twin Paradox: A Thought Experiment
- One twin travels near light speed, the other stays on Earth.
- Upon return, the traveling twin is younger.
- Resolves via acceleration breaking symmetry in reference frames.

[Experimental Evidence of Time Dilation
- Muon decay experiments confirm time dilation.
- GPS satellites must correct for relativistic effects to maintain accuracy.

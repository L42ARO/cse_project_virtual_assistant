[Introduction to Special Relativity
- Classical physics assumes space and time are absolute.
- In the 19th century, Newtonian mechanics was the standard model.
- The discovery of electromagnetism hinted at inconsistencies in classical mechanics.
- The need for a new framework arose from experimental observations.

[Postulates of Special Relativity
- Albert Einstein proposed two fundamental postulates:
  1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
  2. The speed of light in a vacuum is constant, regardless of the observer's motion.
- These postulates contradict classical notions of absolute space and time.

[Galilean Relativity and Its Limitations
- Galileo's principle of relativity states that motion is relative; physics is the same in all inertial frames.
- Galilean transformations assume absolute time and space, leading to incorrect predictions for light.
- Example: If a train moves at 100 km/h and a person inside throws a ball at 10 km/h, an outside observer sees 110 km/h.
- But this logic fails for light, as experiments show its speed remains unchanged.

[The Michelson-Morley Experiment
- Designed to detect the motion of Earth through a supposed 'luminiferous ether'.
- Used an interferometer to measure differences in light speed in different directions.
- Result: No difference detected, contradicting the ether hypothesis.
- This result laid the foundation for Einsteinâ€™s special relativity.

[Implications for the Nature of Space and Time
- If the speed of light is constant, then time and space must be relative.
- Leads to effects like time dilation and length contraction.
- The nature of simultaneity is no longer absolute.
- Introduces the concept of spacetime as a unified entity.
